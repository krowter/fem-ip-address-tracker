## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- SASS (CSS Preprocessor)
- Fastify

### What I learned

This is my first project with SASS, yay :) So far I have pleasant experience using it. The selector nesting wasn't new as I have been using styled-components to date. But I'm looking forward to using @mixin and @function.
